# CSE 310 - Module Report

Name: Caleb Tubbs

## Part 1 - Module Planning

This section should be filled on the first Monday of the Sprint and submitted

### Section 1.1 - Module Selection

1. What Sprint is this for (1-5)?
1

2. Select the Module (with a single X) that you will do this Sprint:

|Module                   |Selected Module|
|-------------------------|---------------|
|Cloud Databases          |               |
|Data Analysis            |               |
|Game Framework           |               |
|GIS Mapping              |               |
|Mobile App               |               |
|Networking               |               |
|SQL Relational Databases |      X        |
|Web Apps                 |               |
|C++                      |               |
|Java                     |               |
|Kotlin                   |               |
|Erlang                   |               |
|TypeScript               |               |
|Rust                     |               |
|Choose Your Own Adventure|               |

3. Find the list of unique requirements for your selected module in the Module Summary in Canvas.  In some circumstances, you will need to modify the requirements based on the technology or language you selected.  For the Choose Your Own Adventure, you need to create your own requirements.  List the unique module requirements below:

You must create a database for your program to use including at least one table to store data into.

Your software must demonstrate the ability to insert, modify, delete, and retrieve (or query) data.

This module requires more than just creating the database and determining SQL commands. You must write software that builds the SQL commands, submits them, receives the results from the database, and uses the results in some way.

### Section 1.2 - Planning

During the Sprint, you will spend 4 hours in class meetings, 4 hours on your team project (2 of which during class), and 10 hours on your selected module.  Make a plan for your 10 hours by answering the questions below.  You should refer back to this plan and make adjustments during the Sprint.

1. What sources have you selected to learn the technical material?

SQLite 
VsCode
Python

2. What is your plan to practice the new material?  In other words, what is the order in which you plan to learn the material before working on your demonstration software?

I plan on refreshing my memory on sql and databses first. After this I will look at tutorials for SQLite and then get to work on the database that I want to create for this assignment.

3. What demonstration software do you plan on submitting at the end of the Sprint (note that this can and may change)?

I plan on giving code that shows CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

4. Identify the days, times, and locations that you will work on the module.

I am still unsure of exact dates that I will work on this project. I know that I can over the weekend but the other times may be full up.

5. Identify both a technical risk and a behavioral risk that you antcipate may occur during this Sprint.  What is your mitgigation plan?

A technical risk that can happen in probelms using SQLite. To mitigate it I want to make sure it is all installed correcty and I know how to use it. A behavioral risk could be me giving up to soon and not doing my best work. This should be simple to mitigate by giving myself time to do things the right way.
## Part 2 - Time Log

This section should be filled out during the Sprint. 

Record all CSE 310 work that you do on your individual module or the team project.  Include time learning, practicing, developing, testing, and documenting.  Don't include time spent in the 4 class meetings (Planning, Stand-Up, Team Review, and Individual Review).  You will need to sum of these hours at the end of the Sprint. Note that the hours you report will affect your grades.

Note that `IM` stands for Individual Module and `TP` stands for Team Project.

## Part 3 - Module Results

This section should be filled out at the end of the Sprint and submitted. 

1. Put your GitHub link for your demonstration software here:  https://github.com/crtubbbs/Book_monitor_Sql

2. Put your YouTube link for your code walkthrough and demo video here: https://youtu.be/5lCLspIyTpA

3. Complete the following checklist by either indicating "Yes" or "No". If you indicate "No" then provide an explanation of why beneath the table.

|Question                                                    |Response|
|------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
|Are the links above public and working?                     |   Y    |
|Did you complete all the unique requirements for the module?|   Y    |
|Did you write at least 100 lines of code?                   |   Y    |
|Did you fully complete the readme.md file?                  |   Y    |
|Did you put the readme.md file in GitHub in the top folder? |   Y    |

4. If you completed a Stretch Challenge (as shown in the Module Description document in Canvas) then describe what you did.  If you did the Choose Your Own Adventure module, then you get to decide what qualifies as a Stretch Challenge.

5. Did you change your selected module during the middle of the Sprint?  If yes, then describe what you changed it to, when you changed it, and why you changed it.
No
6. Using the log above, fill in the total hours and minutes you spent on the individual module:

|Activity         |Total Hours:Minutes|
|-----------------|-------------------|
|Individual Module|         10        |

7. What strategies (behavioral and technical) worked well during this Sprint?  What did not work well?  List some possible ways that you can improve next Sprint.

What worked well for me is when I would dedicate a time to work on this project. There were many times when I would say that I need to work on it but would not, when I would say I will work on it at this time I actually did. I am disapointed with the work that got completed the first week. I did not do enough working in the first week which made me work twice as hard during week 2. This will be the problem I solve this upcoming sprint.
